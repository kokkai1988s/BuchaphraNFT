## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Desaturated beige (#F5F5DC) for a neutral, calming backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted red-brown (#8B4513) to highlight interactive elements and add warmth.
- Headline font: 'Playfair' (serif) for an elegant, high-end feel.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for clear readability.
- Use classic, slightly ornate icons related to amulets and spirituality, but with a modern, minimalist twist. Consider using line icons with subtle gradients.
- Clean, gallery-style layout that allows for a focus on displaying images. Implement a dynamic grid layout that adjusts based on screen size and content, ensuring optimal viewing on all devices.
- Subtle, modern animations and transitions throughout the site. Use Framer Motion or similar libraries for smooth, physics-based animations. Examples include parallax scrolling effects, subtle hover animations on amulet cards, and a loading animation with a stylized amulet icon.
- Implement a color scheme toggle allowing users to switch between the traditional gold/beige/brown and a modern, high-contrast dark mode with neon accents for a futuristic feel. For AI integration, consider using gradients that shift based on AI analysis confidence levels.
- Incorporate variable fonts to allow for subtle adjustments to font weight and style based on user preferences or context. This can enhance readability and create a more personalized experience.
- Utilize a card-based design with a subtle depth effect (e.g., box-shadow or slight 3D tilt) to make the amulet cards pop off the screen. Implement a smooth, animated transition when opening an amulet's detail page.
- Consider using animated icons or micro-interactions to provide visual feedback and enhance the user experience. For example, the 'Worthy of Worship' icon could have a subtle animation when clicked. Use AI-generated icons to reflect real-time insights about each amulet.
- Apply a rainbow gradient to all text elements, creating a vibrant and dynamic visual experience.
